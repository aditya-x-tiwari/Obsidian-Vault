## How Memory Works

### Role of Different Parts of Brain:
- **Neurons:** Fundamental building blocks of the brain, play a crucial role in the process of memory formation and retention.
- **Synapses:** **Interconnecting bridges that allow neurons to communicate with each other**. When we learn something new, electrical signals are transmitted through these **synapses,** which in turn **produce neurotransmitters responsible for the storage of memories**
- **Hippocampus and Prefrontal cortex:**  Involved in analyzing perceptions and deciding what information to store,
- **Amygdala:** Plays a vital role in **integrating emotions and memory**
- **Mechanism Of Procrastination:** When faced with a difficult task, the **prefrontal cortex sends signals to the amygdala,** the part of the brain associated with emotion, **to initiate a stress response.** This stress response activates the release of cortisol, a hormone that is associated with the **body's response to stress, and creates physical discomfort in our body.** This discomfort is what we perceive as pain, and **it's what makes procrastination so difficult to overcome.**
- **Beating Procrastination:** **Understand your habits**, Take notes consisting of your **cue, routine, reward, and belief** and do **Time blocking** that is, assign task to each time of the day.

### Types of Memory
- Memory is an intricate process that involves multiple stages. These stages are **sensory, short-term, and long-term memory.** 
- **Sensory memory:** First stage of memory that receives and processes fleeting impressions of your perceptions. It is responsible for holding raw information for a **very short time,** no more than a few seconds.
- **Short-term memory:** Second stage of memory like a storage unit that holds about four chunks of information and **lasts for 20-30 seconds.** The brain processes and stores the information currently in use, such as a phone number, an address, or a short message. 
- **Long-term memory:** This stage is **responsible for storing and retrieving information for an extended period.** The long-term memory capacity is vast, and it is where the most important and meaningful memories are stored.
### Memory Processes
- **Better Encoding ensures better short-term memory. Better Storage and Recall  ensures better transition from short-term to long-term memory.**
- **Encoding:** Process of transforming information into a meaningful code that can be stored in memory.
- **Storage:** Process of retaining that information over time. 
- **Retrieval:** Process of accessing stored information when needed.**
- Let's discuss techniques to improve each of them. 
## Encoding

**Cognitive Engagement** is the **process of engaging different parts of brain.**

>[!tip] **Effective Cognitive Engagement fosters more retention and processing.**
Cognitive Engagement **should be coherent to the learning data.** Like say you are watching a podcast, what you hear is data but you just see two people sitting and moving their lips which is incoherent to what you are learning so it does act as a **distracton** or **inefficient cognitive engagement which adds up to Cognitive Load which increases focus overall but decreases attention from the actual data source.** On the contrary, one of the best encoding is done while doing things practically, where vision, audio , touch, feelings like emotion to try something unknown something new is achieved and hence it's one of the best ways to learn things

### Techniques to better Encoding : 
#### Priming
Priming involves **exposure to learning material.** This can be done through various methods like:
- **Reading:** Reading about a topic before studying it.
- **Watching videos:** Watching documentaries or educational videos related to the subject.
- **Discussions:** Having conversations with others about the topic.
- **Visual aids:** Looking at images or diagrams related to the material.
#### Active Learning Techniques
Engages the brain into learning with passion. One of the Major components for retention.
- **Group Discussions**: Encourage students to discuss topics in small groups, promoting exchange of ideas and critical thinking.
- **Think-Pair-Share**: Students first think about a question individually, then discuss it with a partner before sharing with the larger group.
- **Problem-Based Learning**: Present real-world problems for learners to solve, fostering critical thinking and application of knowledge.

#### Use of Questions
Challenge Previously made neural connections thereby engaging brain the right way.
- **Open-Ended Questions**: Pose questions that require more than yes/no answers, prompting deeper reflection and discussion.
- **Socratic Questioning**: Use a series of guided questions that challenge assumptions, explore implications, and promote deeper understanding.
- **Self-Assessment Questions**: Encourage learners to ask themselves questions about the material, fostering metacognition.

#### Multimodal Learning
- **Incorporate Various Formats**: Use a mix of text, videos, audios,  and interactive tools to engage senses thereby engaging different areas of brain.
- **Visual Aids**:  Language was just developed in 3000 BC but Humans could see and identify objects so diagrams, charts, and infographics are very useful with technology to make complex information more accessible and relatable. Better steps could also be feeling things through a virtual reality.
- **Gamification**: Incorporate game elements (like points, badges, or challenges) to make learning more engaging and motivating.


#### Real-World Applications
- **Case Studies**: Use real-life examples that apply theoretical concepts, helping learners see the relevance of what they are studying.
- **Field Trips and Experiments**: Engage learners with hands-on experiences that connect classroom knowledge to the outside world because here is where they are to apply their knowledge.

#### Reflective Practices
- **Journaling**: Encourage learners to keep journals where they reflect on what they’ve learned, how they feel about it, and how it connects to their lives.
- **Peer Feedback**: Have students provide feedback to one another, promoting reflection and critical evaluation of their own and others’ work.

### Why Maximizing Cognitive Load Is Counterproductive
#### Problems
1. **Overload and Fatigue**: Excessive cognitive load can lead to mental fatigue, reducing focus and retention. When the brain is overwhelmed, it may struggle to process and store information effectively.
    
2. **Shallow Processing**: If cognitive load is too high, learners may resort to surface-level processing rather than deep understanding, leading to poor retention and recall.
    
3. **Decreased Motivation**: High cognitive load can be frustrating, leading to disengagement and reduced motivation to learn.

#### Overcoming Strategies 
- **Break Down Tasks**: Divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts and provide guidance to help students progress at their own pace.
- **Provide Resources**: Offer supplemental materials (like guides or reference sheets) that learners can use to support their understanding.
- **Mindfulness Practices**: Incorporate mindfulness activities, like breathing exercises or short meditations, to help students focus and reduce distractions.
- **Attention Management**: Teach strategies for managing attention, such as the Pomodoro Technique, which balances study and break periods.
- **Encouragement and Support**: Create an atmosphere where students feel safe to express their thoughts, ask questions, and make mistakes.
- **Celebrate Successes**: Acknowledge and celebrate individual and group achievements to boost motivation and engagement.
- **Limit Multitasking**: Focus on one task at a time. Multitasking can overload your cognitive capacity, making it harder to store information effectively. Single-tasking allows for deeper processing and better retention.

### Which Content Type Is Best For Learning ?

- **Language has very limited influence** when compared to other visual aids like images which represent real-life things virtually. **Pairing with right audio** is even better but still less than 3D VR and practical experience. Hence **Content Type which is more engaging has greater cognitive loads than the other.**
- **Reading Text is customizable to one's processing speed** whereas **Videos do not align well and brain is not actively engaged with the material.**
- Find your fine line to cognitive engagement and **choose the best fitting content.** For example, Learning Quantum Mechanics is very hard and already needs a lot of cognitive engagement so source has to be text as things are far away from reality and videos might increasingly get the cognitive engagement loaded in the process.


## Storage (Memory Retention) 

**Storage involves taking short-term to long-term memory.**
### Improving Storage
#### Using Mnemonics  
Mnemonics are made by **creating associations between the information you want to remember and other things that you already know.**
- **Why:** This technique works because the brain is **naturally wired to remember things that are meaningful and connected to other information.**  
- **Using mnemonics the right way:** It's important to **create associations that are vivid, meaningful, and easy to remember and makes sense to you personally.**  

---
#### Chunking
Chunking is a technique for memorizing information by **grouping it into smaller chunks, making it easier to remember.**
- **Helps to create meaningful connections:** Information is **easier to recall later, more manageable and easier to process** 
- **Effectively use chunking:** It's important to **give the task your undivided attention and then find the overall big picture and key idea.**

---
#### Interleaving
 The key to effective interleaving is to ensure that you are **constantly switching between different types of problems or materials** in a way that allows your brain to make new connections between ideas and to think in a more flexible and adaptable way. 

- **Constantly challenges your brain to adapt to new situations:** Training is **more flexible and adaptable, which can lead to deeper understanding and more efficient learning.** 
- **Help to prevent boredom and keep you engaged in the learning process**

---

#### Deep Sleep and Rest  
 A regular sleep schedule with aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night is best.
- **Avoiding caffeine and screens before bedtime and creating a relaxing sleep environment helps you fall asleep easily.**
- **Crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive function:** During sleep, the brain processes and consolidates memories, making connections between different pieces of information.
- **Improves cognitive function, including attention, problem-solving, and decision-making abilities:** In contrast, **not getting enough sleep can lead to fatigue, poor memory retention, and decreased cognitive function.**

## Recall 
### Increasing Effective Recall

#### Notes
Notes are **essential for revising the information later on when needed:**
- **Involving Priming:** Notes should be **made partly before-hand with priming** and **completed during the encoding process** which is the best way to make notes. 
- **Notes should resemble with the way of output data:** For example,  if you want data to be able to act out then watch your own video while doing it. Text notes are not good here. Similarly if you need to remember something just revise the previous connects with mind-maps.
- **Organize your materials:** Use **outlines or concept maps.** This structure helps **create connections between ideas themselves** fostering cognitive engagement. It can be achieved with **mind maps** and even to large extent with **hierarchical data structure**.
- **Avoid Pretty Notes:** As the **focus is more on the looks and less on the quality of information you are reading.**
- **Focus on Note-Making and not Note-Taking:** Write things in your own words and do not copy paste

>[!question] Handwritten vs Typed Notes  ? 
> Handwriting slows down the note-taking process, forcing the brain to **analyze, rephrase, and store information** more effectively.  - **Handwriting** is quantitatively better for **conceptual and long-term retention** (by ~22-32%).
>Typing enables fast note-taking but **reduces the cognitive load**, leading to passive learning and weaker long-term retention. **Typing** excels in **speed and organization** but sacrifices depth (10-15% retention loss over time).
>Typing is Useful in scenarios like : **Mechanical Learning Tasks** (e.g., vocabulary lists, simple code snippets), **Large Volumes of Information** that require quick capture and searchability and **Collaborative projects** using digital platforms (e.g., Google Docs, Notion).

>[!quote] William Zinnser
> Clear thinking becomes Clear Writing. 
> One cannot exist without the other 


>[!tip] My Note-Making Format
> **Start with name of the note as heading:** Makes a note independent of the filename.
> Proceed with **headings for title and bullet points for content**
> Content involves **topic in bold and expanded after a colon**
> **Important content is in bold**
> **Callouts highlight summaries, general questions etc.**

#### Spaced Repetition  
It **involves repeating what you are trying to remember over several days** to strengthen synaptic connections in your brain.
The technique, much like watering a plant, requires the right amount of repetition at the right intervals to achieve optimal growth. We do remember things for as we fall short to apply them in our daily lives it goes into the loop of forgetting curve
Take a look at the Forgetting curve here - [[forgetting_curve.webp]]
 
- **Takes advantage of the brain's natural learning processes:** When you learn something new, your brain creates **new synapses that are relatively weak at first and can easily be forgotten. By repeating the material over several days, the synapses become stronger and more permanent,** making it easier to recall the information later on.
- **Prevent forgetting by refreshing the memory at regular intervals**

---
#### Testing 
Way of actively engaging with the material to recall things. 
- **Testing knowledge indirectly:** Focus on **different applications of the knowledge.** 
- **Involving Related Concepts:** Involving another concept this helps to **build newer and better brain connections.**
- **Frequent Testing:** To be done frequently as the spaced repetition so as to strengthen the connections and maintain the forgetting curve.
