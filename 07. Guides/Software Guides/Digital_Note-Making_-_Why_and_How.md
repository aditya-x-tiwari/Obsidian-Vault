- **Links**: Add hyperlinks by specifying the text and URL also may add `"Hovering Text like this"` **after the URL** as -  [This text is shown](http://example.com "I am displayed on being hovered"). Links can be given to internal markdown files as well as  [Type Anchor Here](Obsidian_Guide.md "Hovering text")
   
> [!info] Specific Sections can be referenced after list in markdown format, headers using `#` and rest anything using `^` [[Digital_Note-Making_-_Why_and_How#Markdown Guide]]

>[!danger] ### Escape blank spaces in links 
If your URL contains blank spaces, you must escape them by - replacing them with `%20` as [Obsidian Note](Obsidian_Guide.md) or also escape the URL by wrapping it with angled brackets (`< >`) as [Obsidian Note](<Obsidian_Guide.md>) 

- **Media**: Embed media using a link to the image file. Note that size is specified after putting`|` **in square brackets** . Place `!` to show the media in the file itself. ![Alt text| 600](WIN_20241001_22_02_47_Pro.jpg)

| Header 2    | Header 1    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Row 1 Col 2 | Row 1 Col 1 |
