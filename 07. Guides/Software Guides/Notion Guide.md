Notion is a powerful system widely used for **creating workspaces and working on projects online** mostly. Its UI is very user friendly and things are mostly drag and drop

Here's a **complete guide** on using Notion:

To use Notion, you need either the app but it also runs on chrome itself. Data is stored on Notion Servers and everything is rendered with internet.
#### General Tips :

- **Toggles** are an excellent way to keep your **content organized and clean.**
- **Callouts** are perfect for **highlighting key takeaways.**
- A **Table of Contents is essential for long pages.**
- **Synced blocks** allow you to synchronize **data across your pages.**
- **Buttons** are crucial for **automation.**
- You can create **flowcharts using Mermaid code.**
- **Inline Databases** are best for specific or **local use cases.**
- For large datasets, prefer Linked Databases over Inline Databases.
- Automation, both with and without buttons, is a must-have feature.
- **Templates add convenience** to your workflow.
- **Advanced Filters** offer **powerful data manipulation capabilities.**
- **Filtering** in various **database views is highly recommended.**
- **Grouping** can work wonders **in complex databases.**
- **Database views** are **invaluable tools** in any data management situation.

#### Advanced Features -

1. **Relations & Rollups:** Connections established **between two entities**. Access can be one-way or two-way. For example, a project comprises many interlinked tasks—a one-sided relation. Conversely, a task common to two projects represents a two-sided relation. Rollups are properties of one entity when accessed by another in its relation. For instance, the status of a task when viewed from a related projects database.
2. **Subitems and Dependencies:** These function similarly to subpages but within a database. **Dependencies create a locked flowchart in timeline view where altering the first item changes all subsequent dependencies**. For example, when learning a language, the process starts with alphabets, then words, then sentences. If you assign dates to these tasks and later shift one, you needn't adjust the others—the system automatically recognizes that without learning alphabets, you can't learn words.
3. **Formulas:** These can be used similarly to Excel. Various programming approaches can be applied using the formula property. Look up some formulas for reference.
4. **Workspaces**: Use emails to add people to different workspaces. Collaborators can **only access subpages, not parent pages.**
