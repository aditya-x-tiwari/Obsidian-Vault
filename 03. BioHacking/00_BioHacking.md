# 00_BioHacking

>[!info] This is a Human User-Manual. Here we discuss everything that our body needs for longevity. Understand and apply.

## Abstract
Biohacking involves using scientific knowledge of the body to optimize health, performance, and wellbeing. To effectively do biohacking, you'll need to understand the human body deeply, starting with foundational knowledge and moving into more advanced areas related to biology, physiology, and even psychology. Here’s the recommended order for studying the human body for biohacking:

---

##  Cellular Biology (Foundation)
   - **Why start here**: The body is made of trillions of cells. Understanding cellular processes gives you insight into how energy is produced and how nutrients and signals are processed.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - **Cell structure and function** (e.g., mitochondria, nucleus, cell membranes).
     - **Metabolism**: How your body converts food into energy (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ATP).
     - **Gene expression**: How your genes influence your health and how you can potentially modulate them through lifestyle choices.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how cells generate energy, the role of antioxidants, and how lifestyle choices affect cellular aging.

---

## Biochemistry
   - **Why this next**: After cells, you need to understand the chemical processes that keep them alive and functional.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and their breakdown.
     - Enzyme function and how different compounds (like supplements) affect enzyme activity.
     - Hormones and their biochemical impact on energy, mood, and metabolism.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how diet, fasting, and supplements can optimize cellular function and metabolism.

---

## Nervous_System
   - **Why this next**: The brain and nervous system control nearly every aspect of your body. Understanding how neurons communicate and how your brain processes information is key to cognitive enhancement.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Brain structure and function (cortex, cerebellum, brainstem).
     - Neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, GABA) and their role in mood, focus, and mental health.
     - **Neuroplasticity**: How the brain can change and adapt, and how to optimize learning and memory.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to improve cognitive function with nootropics, sleep optimization, meditation, and brain training.

---

## Endocrine_System 
   - **Why important**: Hormones play a critical role in regulating mood, metabolism, energy levels, and overall health.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Major hormones (cortisol, testosterone, estrogen, insulin) and how they influence energy and mood.
     - Circadian rhythms and how your hormonal cycles are tied to sleep, stress, and recovery.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to optimize hormonal balance with proper diet, light exposure, stress management, and sleep regulation.

---

## Digestive_System
   - **Why this next**: The gut is considered a "second brain" because of its profound impact on mental and physical health.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Gut microbiome: The role of gut bacteria in digestion, mood, and immune health.
     - Nutrient absorption and how food choices affect bioavailability.
     - The link between digestion, brain function, and overall wellness (gut-brain axis).

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to optimize digestion with probiotics, prebiotics, intermittent fasting, and gut-friendly diets.

---

## Cardiovascular_System
   - **Why this next**: Your heart and blood vessels transport essential nutrients and oxygen throughout your body. Healthy cardiovascular function is key to biohacking longevity.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Heart function and how blood flow impacts overall health.
     - Blood pressure, cholesterol, and their role in metabolic health.
     - The role of exercise and lifestyle changes in cardiovascular health.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to improve heart health through exercise, diet (e.g., omega-3s), and techniques like cold exposure.

---

## Musculoskeletal_System
   - **Why this next**: Optimizing muscle function and bone health is essential for physical performance and long-term mobility.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Muscle function, growth, and repair (role of protein synthesis).
     - Bone density and how diet and exercise can impact skeletal health.
     - Exercise physiology: How muscles respond to different types of exercise (strength training, endurance).

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to optimize physical performance through resistance training, mobility exercises, and recovery techniques.

---

## Immune_System
   - **Why important**: A strong immune system is essential for fighting disease and keeping the body healthy.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Immune responses: How the body detects and destroys pathogens.
     - Inflammation and its role in health and disease.
     - Immune-boosting strategies (diet, fasting, sleep).

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to enhance immunity through cold exposure, supplements (vitamin D, zinc), and stress reduction.

---

## Recovery_Systems
   - **Why this next**: Sleep is essential for the body’s recovery, cognitive function, and hormonal balance.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Sleep cycles (REM, deep sleep) and how they affect brain function.
     - Role of melatonin and cortisol in sleep-wake cycles.
     - Impact of sleep on memory, learning, and performance.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to optimize sleep through sleep hygiene, tracking, and techniques like blue light reduction.

---

## Psychological_&_Emotional_Health
   - **Why important**: Emotional well-being and mental resilience are key for overall health and longevity.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Emotional regulation and techniques to manage stress and anxiety.
     - Positive psychology: Building habits for happiness and fulfillment.
     - Mind-body connection and how emotions affect physical health.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to improve emotional health with mindfulness, breathwork, and cognitive-behavioral strategies.

---

## Genetics
   - **Why this last**: Understanding your genetic makeup allows for highly personalized biohacking strategies.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - DNA and gene expression.
     - How lifestyle choices can activate or suppress certain genes (epigenetics).
     - Genetic testing to understand predispositions to certain health conditions.

   **Biohacking Focus**: Learn how to tailor your diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices to optimize gene expression.

Summary
Bryan's diet is vegan by choice, not by necessity.

Before Blueprint Stack Protocol:
Morning Routine:

4:30 - 6:00 AM - Wake Up Naturally (no alarms)

- Measure Body Temperature using a Braun Ear Thermometer - (Bryan's Avg Temp: 96°F, Most People Avg Temp: 98.7°F)

Light Exposure using a UV Light at 10,000 LUX - For a few minutes to set Circadian rhythm (helps to "replace" the sun as their usually is very little sunlight in early mornings)

Oral Care: First use a Waterpik, then Floss (Bryan recommends choosing a brand with a more thicker string), then Brush (Bryan recommends an electric toothbrush with soft brissles and a non-fluoride toothpaste. Also recommends waiting 30 minutes after a meal before brushing), then add 2 drops of Tree Oil to your mouth *some people prefer to dilute it with water first, swish, then rinse, then apply Coq10 gel, then use a Tongue Scraper. *Thanks to u/ZynosAT for pointing this out: Bryan has stopped rinsing with tea tree oil because the data showed it wasn’t necessary for his oral health. It may work for you, however (found in the description of his oral health video). Bryan also uses a mouthwash but only in situations where he will be in close proximity to other people. If you suffer from bruxism like Bryan does, he strongly recommends using a this device. Visit the Dentist every 6 months.

Skin Care: Apply a Mineral Face Sunscreen (Protocol webpage shows Elta MD *confirmed to be his current sunscreen of choice via X, while his evening routine video shows Cerave AM)

Take 2 pills: 10mg of Heme Iron and 250mg of Vitamin C (I could only find this part of the routine in This YT Video from Sep, 2023 where Bryan notes he was trying to get his Iron levels up) - Might be Temporary

Measure weight, muscle, bone, BMI, fat, visceral fat, water, EDa and Heart Rate (Bryan uses a Withings Body Scale

7:00 - 8:00 AM (depending on time Bryan wakes up) - First Meal of the Day

Eat Super Veggie: 150 grams cooked Black lentils, 250 grams Broccoli (head+stalk), 150 grams Cauliflower, 50 grams Shiitake or Maitake Mushrooms, 1 clove (a piece) Garlic, 3 grams Ginger Root, 1 Lime, 1 Tbsp Cumin, 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar, 1 Tbsp Hemp Seeds. After prep: 1 Tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. In his most recent video on diet, he is adding 50 grams of Carrots and 1 Avocado. Optional: Nusalt

*All Organic Ingredients

r/blueprint_ - "Super Veggie makes me suuper happy"
"Super Veggie makes me suuper happy"
How to Prepare Notes: *Boil or steam your chopped ginger and garlic for a few minutes (until soft) BEFORE adding to the plate. Jamie does this in the same pot as the broccoli and cauliflower, which gives the vegetables a nice flavor. *"If you chop your broccoli and cauliflower and let it rest in room temperature open air, then it allows the enzyme in broccoli (myrosinase), which is activated when chopped, to convert more glucoraphanin into sulforaphane, thereby doubling its content! Sulforaphane is the strongest known anti-cancer compound known to us in our food! Same benefits apply for cauliflower" (YT Comment) *"One tip: In Japan, we steam the veggies instead of boiling them to retain as many nutrients as possible." (YT Comment)

8:00 - 9:00 AM (1 Hour after Super Veggie) - Second Meal of the Day

Eat Nutty Pudding: 50-100 mL Macadamia Nut Milk or Almond Milk, 3 Tbsp ground macadamia nuts (20% off), 2 tsp of ground walnuts, 2 Tbsp chia seeds, 1 tsp of ground flaxseed (seed that is ground into flour), 1/4 brazil nut, 6 grams of cocoa powder, 1 tsp sunflower lecithin, 1/2 tsp ceylon cinnamon, 1/2 cup blueberries, raspberries or strawberries (your choice), 3 cherries, 2 oz pomegranate juice. *Bryan supposedly consumes 1 Tbsp of EVOO with every meal, so he might be adding it to the nutty pudding mix or taking it directly, before consuming nutty pudding. Edit: He confirmed he likes it stirred in.

How to Prepare *video forgot to include cocoa powder in recipe

10:00 - finish by 11:00 AM (~ 2 Hours after Nutty Pudding) - Third Meal of the Day

Eat 3rd Meal: For this 3rd Meal, Bryan presents various options that vary and consist of mostly vegetables, nuts, seeds, berries and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. You can change these each day. See here.

r/blueprint_ - Stuffed Sweet Potato
Stuffed Sweet Potato
Take these pills/supplements: Acarbose 200 mg (Rx), BroccoMax 17.5mg, Ca-AKG 1 G, Cocoa Flavanols 500 mg, Garlic 2.4 g equivalent, Garlic 1.2 g (kyolic), Glucosamine Sulphate 2KCL 1,500 mg, Hyaluronic Acid 300 mg, L-Lysine 1g, L-Tyrosine 500 mg, Metformin ER 500 mg (Rx), N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) 1,800 mg, NR 375 mg OR NMN 500 mg, Taurine 1 g, Turmeric 1 g, Viviscal (men) (women) 1 pill

*Bryan also takes the following: Rapamycin (Rx) wk 1: 13 mg wk 2: 9 mg wk 3: 13 mg wk 4: 9 mg, 17α-E2, 8 mg wk transdermal, B12 methylcobalamin 1x/wk. Although it is not properly specified at which time during the day.

*A note on EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) which Bryan takes 3 Tbsp (1 with each meal) daily or 45ml. Edit: Thanks to u/LzzyHalesLegs for finding this, seems that Bryan in this YT Short says he takes 1.5 Tbsp per day or 22ml. But in his most recent video on diet, he still mentions 1 Tbsp per meal. Will update when this is clarified.

These are the criteria Bryan's team suggest when buying EVOO:

r/blueprint_ - "Better than resveratrol, NR, cold plunge, sauna and your favorite podcast"
"Better than resveratrol, NR, cold plunge, sauna and your favorite podcast"
Cold pressed

High polyphenol count (over 400 mg/kg) -Blueprint EVOO has 523.4 mg/kg total biophenols (HPLC)

High Oleic acid count (over 67%) • Blueprint EVOO (May Harvest 2023) has 72.26% oleic acid

Harvest Date • Where possible, try to find EVOO with a recent harvest date. This lets you know when the olives were picked. • The fresher the olives, the more nutrients they’ll have.

UV protectant bottle

Third-Party Tested • Every single batch of oil needs to be quality tested by a trustworthy third party, so you know that it is what it says on the bottle.

*A note on Green Tea/Coffee: Bryan has previously stated, in particular in this video, that he takes up to 5 cups of Green Tea per day. A closer look at his pantry reveal in this video, reveals he takes Yogi's Green Tea Super Antioxidant. In this video, he states he doesn't drink coffee, instead drinks a few cups of green tea per day, totalling 60mg of caffeine per day, which would amount to 4 Tea Bags of Yogi's Green Tea. Keep in mind, these are somewhat older videos, and recently there has not been any talk about Green Tea from Bryan nor in the offical protocol website. We do know, that Bryan doesnt like drinking coffee, as sleep is his coffee.

*A note on fasting and calories: Bryan does 18/6 intermittent fasting, meaning he fasts for 18 hours and only eats in a 6 hour time frame. He has stated that the science of fasting is "not there yet", but he found that when he finishes eating ~8-10 hours prior to sleeping, he gets his best sleep. So the reasoning behind his short very early eating window is mostly for sleep quality. Bryan's total daily calories amounts to ~2,250, which aproximates to a 10% Caloric Restriction. Essentially he is burning more than he consumes. This is NOT ideal for building or sustaining muscle and lowers testosterone, so he has mentioned he supplements testosterone with patches to stay in the normal levels. Edit: He USED TO supplement with testosterone when he was consuming 1950 calories which was 21% Caloric restriction. Now, since he increased his calories to ~2,250, he is no longer taking testosterone.

Afternoon Routine:

12:00 - 6:00 PM - Work, Treatments, Travel Time

*Not much is shown about Bryan's Afternoon routine. We know he mostly travels to work outside of home, (except for when outdoor air quality is very low), is constantly thinking about keeping excellent posture, some days gets new treatments, on weekends enjoys hiking and other activities with his son and friends, and tries to minimize sun exposure.

Stop drinking liquids by 1PM Edit: For further clarification, Bryan does this to get the maximum sleep quality and not be woken up because of the urge to pee. Bryan has tested with various hours and this is what gets the best results (100% sleep). Your time can be different.

Evening Routine:

6:30 PM - Arrive Home

Switch shoes: Bryan has outdoor shoes and indoor shoes for hygiene.

Take Thyroid Medicine: 112 mcg Levothyroxine, 60 mg Armour Thyroid (Bryan was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at age 21). - Personal for Bryan

60 minutes of Audio Cardio for ear health: stimulation within 4,000Hertz and 12,000Hertz (Bryan uses Skullcandy Headphones without Noise Cancellation) - Experimental, not yet proven

Work on Lung Capacity (Looks like Bryan uses a MIR Spiro or a Airofit Pro)

Skin Care: Apply Facial Cleanser and then Moisturizer (Protocal webpage shows he uses Vanicream Cleanser and Moisturizer, but in his evening routine video he shows Cerave Cleanser and Cerave PM Moisturizer). Then apply a Peptide Serum (couldn't find the exact brand/product). Also apply Tretinoin .1% (couldn't find exact brand). *Bryan does a lot of interventions for his skin, primarily involving lasers, these are what make most of the difference in his skin.

Oral Care: First use a Waterpik, then Floss (Bryan recommends choosing a brand with a more thicker string), then Brush (Bryan recommends an electric toothbrush with soft brissles and a non-fluoride toothpaste. Also recommends waiting 30 minutes after a meal before brushing), then add 2 drops of Tree Oil to your mouth *some people prefer to dilute it with water first, swish, then rinse, then apply Coq10 gel, then use a Tongue Scraper. Bryan also uses a mouthwash but only in situations where he will be in close proximity to other people. If you suffer from bruxism like Bryan does, he strongly recommends using a this device. Visit the Dentist every 6 months. Video Demonstration

*Bryan applies a Hair concoction to reverse gray hair and a Testosterone patch of 2ml

7:00PM - Wind Down Period (get into sleep mode)

*Bryan likes to hang out with son, read, talk, etc.

*Avoid screens or anything that gets you stressed. Avoid alcohol and stimulants. Avoid Blue Light (use blue light blocking glasses and Blue Light Blocking features on devices if you are looking at screens).

Take 300 mcg Melatonin (no liquid)

10 Minutes of Pulsetto or Sensate to relieve stress before going to bed

8:30 PM (non-negotiable) - Sleep
