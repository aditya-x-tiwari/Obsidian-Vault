# Great Picture Poses
## Few Tips
- **Tap and Long Press on Subject:** Get right exposure and focus.
- **Get Macro photos in raw mode:** You can always edit them later. But resolution you get is greater.
- **Pretending Camera isn't there:** Makes pictures natural as if you were in motion.
- **Contrast With Surrounding:** Makes it more appealing.
- **Be More Spread Out:** Makes You feel confident.
- **Hold something in hands:** Ensures that your hands are busy.
- **Shoot from midsection:** Best Place as full face and outfit is visible
- **Add Timer in night mode:** Shutter speed should be low for low light. Clicking with fingers disturbs that.
