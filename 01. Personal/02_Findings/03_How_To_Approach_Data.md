Before Diving into anything, we need data. Evolution has trained us with very basic data for survival which is present in our genes. But as we know, today we need far more than that. Data is unlimited. Learning about a fantasy concept is of no use in the reality. Hence Learn Data You Need.

**Use it or Lose it** applies greatly in context of human body. Human Body is not a storage space like ROM instead it's more of a processing unit. We tend to forget things we once did but did not practice be it studies or physical activity. But **learning any new data is a practice ground as it aids in problem-solving skills, logical thinking and structured approach to complex topics.**

Every Subject exists because it is needed. But we do not need each and every data in a subject. Data of importance needs to be studied extensively, but till a level which it deserves. It is also completely normal to ignore data which has no relevance to your life.

**Data must be in a most optimized and compact form** which produces the right stimuli or cognitive load for understanding as **time and energy is limited** for any System. [Refer this to know why ](How To Study and Learn) and [this to know how](Digital_Note-Making_-_Why_and_How).

Leave out everything only things that are relevant to you are the three spheres of life and anything linked to them. Once this is completed then move on to your next larger goal as discussed earlier.

>[!info] **Fun-Fact:** It's not humanly possible to cover or practice a subject completely. 
>Data seems to be extremely tough to understand 

Thus we should **focus on overall or holistic development of an individual**, focusing on just one practical application as our profession. Getting to know about your professional subjects does not mean to leave general studies, we should devote to general studies first, complete it and look to our aim or profession in the long-term because these are mock data you are trained for, and peer-learning for some may ease out the process. Hence it is our general motto to attain subjects most diligently if possibly permitted by other factors. **Learning is an exercise for brain if you need it in future you remember it, else slowly forget it.** Hence even if the subject does not interest you, study to get good marks, exercise your brain. Goodbye !
