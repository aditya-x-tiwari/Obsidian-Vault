# What_Is_This

We as humans have limited capabilities, we ourselves are confused about what is happening. It appears so simple from the top but it's really chaotic from inside. We even do not know what we are observing through senses are to be believed or not. But if we do not believe what we observe, then what is left to be believed. Hence we must believe our observation and know their limitations.

This documentation is nothing but a small light amidst the darkness. This is a interpretation of data available till time in short it's summary of how to proceed from a perspective of a simple human being who is himself confused but believes in himself and never ever gives up. Note that this documentation is a concise form of data collected from various resources. Concise since we as humans ourselves are limited, we cannot maintain huge data.

Data is covered in **English** as data till now is present in it and is unlikely to change. Nothing other than this preface, the mission is a permanent part of the idea. Change is the ultimate rule of life. This info is subject to change at any point in time and is trying hard to keep himself with the present.
Note that changing with the change is impossible while being stagnant is useless hence change this document when the change is stable. This **document is there to back you and not lead you. You have to keep up with the change first.** Every smallest details are made in point with reason. **Read as per your Wish..............**
