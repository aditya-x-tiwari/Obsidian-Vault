## Abstract
Do you really need to know your this. Forget everything remove every thought from your mind  and Look for your 
- Health, is inflamed to such an extent it has never experienced what a completely healthy body feels like. You got lack of great bone structure, lack of muscles, even lack of clean air to breathe and water to drink, there is even lack of proper sleep, lack of essential supplements which you should be having to live healthy and certain other supplements which would have made living even better all of these you could have had if you were rich enough....**"Physical Win Lost"**
- Mind, is barred from your freedom you are forced to do things. Never in life you had the chance of exploring new things. Even if you found something interesting you had to sacrifice them for your current job or lack of relevance with your career....**"Mental Win Lost"**
- Future, even with so much tolerance what comes in the way is a **Ugly Indian** family ahead and a **hunched back 6"4' guy with unused potential, forced to grow stunted lacking wealth....** **"Social Win Lost"**
Come on you are not made for this ....... [[Are you locked in or just dreaming motivation.mp4]]
All these markers just indicate that you need money just money. Your life hasn't ended yet, you are just a slave. Escape the matrix my man, you are made for bigger things.
Mark my words, **" This thought won't go away it will haunt you till death. You will die twice on each of those days you remember this..."**

## Discussion?

 In the next part of the journey what you encounter is devices. Something which takes a input, gives a output and performs a process in between. You are also a device. The surroundings are also made of devices. You need them to work for you as they are required in many aspects of life. Use devices as solutions don't focus much. Focus on the problem and the general solution for it. Specific Solutions or devices should be configured and used and not focused upon. They Come and Go. Follow the message not the messenger.

>[!quote] Plato said Necessity is the mother of invention

Henceforth why to discuss these, if it's truly needed we will actually find a way to make it happen. 
But, Brain is a pleasure seeking organ it is the way we are designed we need to look at our evolution. Evolution prepared us for basic survival and procreation now those are met. Evolution just gave us a half of the brain which is logical. We need to know how to use it. [More details here](D_Cognition)

Pleasure-Seeking is a necessary evil. It is a loophole we need to think about how insignificant it is compared to the three spheres. This barrier cannot be mitigated completely because you cannot be thinking like this all the time hence we need a belief system without any loopholes. 

Hence we need a system, a strong belief system with rewards that can turn off the primate brain which is pleasure seeking and divert ourselves towards something that is actually worth it.

That System is what we are building here. Solutions exist for this and all other such problems in various religions but they are too old and are never subject to change or questioning hence it is required to prepare one for us. This will include a lot of devices, but before that we need something.
## Discipline
To do all these what you need is **Time Management** which is is easily achieved by having a consistent routine.
Routine does not impose restrictions but manages distractions and make time for work you need to do. Remember it is the first thing taught in School, Army **that is why there are deadlines in the work**. People unable to make a routine for their own work, work as employees for a person able to make it. This is the secret known to everyone yet followed by successful ones. Here is a basic routine that you should **follow it as a ritual without disturbance** until you know how it is configured to the best for you:

| **Time**                | **Activity**          | **Details**                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4:45 - 6:45 AM (X)**  | Wake up               | Wake Up Without Alarm and Freshen Up                          |
| **X - 9:00 AM**         | Deep Creative Work    | Study, read books, or explore new topics.                     |
| **9:00 - 10:00 AM**     | Breakfast and Chores* | For Saturday:Running, Sunday:Cleaning and Weekdays:Commuting. |
| **10:00 - 1:00 AM**     | Work                  | Focused work or study without distractions.                   |
| **2:00 - 2:30 PM**      | Lunch                 | Complete Full Lunch and get a power nap.                      |
| **2:30 - 5:30 PM**      | Work/Study            | Continue with tasks or learning sessions.                     |
| **5:30 - 6:30 PM**      | Physical Activity     | Sports, Weight Training etc                                   |
| **6:30 - Y PM**         | Learning and Dinner   | Light Dinner and Work like Journaling.                        |
| **8:45 - 10:45 PM (Y)** | Go to Sleep           | Aim for uninterrupted sleep until 6:45 AM.                    |
The above routine is based on **circadian rhythm**.
Sleep - Systems operate in cycles, work is obtained with a specific process and time only. System needs some time to recover to recover the system. This is sleep.
Neglect this period from the total time as if it does not exist. Like 12 hours of the day from 9 pm to 9 am you are dead to the world you are with yourself only. You do not owe anything to the world during this time. Hence we have only 12 hours a day.
