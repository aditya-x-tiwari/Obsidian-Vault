# 02_Guide_You_Need_Before_Starting_Out_Anything

## Abstract

Now that we know that data should be in most efficient form. Our Brain is not used to store information its a processing unit made to be in the present and act accordingly. so a very efficient and functional external system is required, it should track the problem solved by our brain so that we need not solve it again and dig up the past. The System should store things in order that it is easier for you to retrieve later on. This system is completely dependent on time as such things evolve with time.

## Training Roadmap for Mind 
- Now that we know about data generation, operation and storage let's get started with our first sphere, Health. Let's discuss every sub-detail and understand ourselves first completely. Know every detail about the physical body we are in. [Start here](00_BioHacking)
- After completing Health sphere, then by understanding our needs we will move forward to exploring these software. After that begins the journey to complete the next sphere, Mind. Know every data that is needed to defeat the spheres. During this time we will also try to accommodate wealth and continue going ahead. 
- All of the journey is never saturated but yes after a level of success we can move on to finally defeat the first sphere, Health by not dying. What comes next is the ultimate goal of human existence finding the answers to this universe. But all that day-dreaming is prohibited as you know.......

Pick Up Sources that must **align with your learning objectives** like try to **approach the application part of anything.** Say you have to train for a cricket match. You got three sessions to practice. You can watch videos of people playing and learn but that's not a smart way as it will not build the motor connections. Then again you have two options train different variety of shots each day or train one shot and be perfect with that or you choose a way somewhat in between you learn to somehow make good enough shots but not with one type but with many types that's a right way.
Anyways you can look into this context from here: [[D_Cognition]] Actually, You must first understand the human body because we need to understand the system first. Then move on to learn and train data about various other aspects of life starting with those that are necessary.
