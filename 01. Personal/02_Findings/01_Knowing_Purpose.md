# 01_Knowing_Purpose
## Who are you ?
You are a human being, a possible combination of elements. Your existence is the result of millions of years of evolution, a process driven by natural selection. Hence any decision you make should **consider the Modernity as well as the way Evolution shaped us.**

## Is God and Religion Purpose?
**Anything undiscovered, unreasoned circumstance is related to God.** We don't know who or what is behind it so a general rule of thumb is to associate it with God. The choice is yours **either fear 99 unknown things or fear God**, one pseudo-thing which engulfs every unknown thing in itself.
  
Humans are trying their best to find answers to every unknown phenomenon through Science.
But we too have limited capabilities. We cannot rely on the pictures shown by our animal brain.

**Religion**, introduced by the world is almost **right set of rules that somehow work** and can be applied to the majority **without understanding things in depth.** Do not spend much time on this, it's all a **belief system.** Your best first pick the one which resembles with your history.

## Why are we questioning all these things? 
Evolution made Humans far more capable than just living for **Survival and Procreation**. 
Humans are trying to reveal things so that they know something beyond mere **Survival and Procreation**.
  
So we are questioning all of these to find the actual purpose in one's life......

## What is NOT the purpose of One's life?
**Inaction** or, Uselessly sitting and wondering about finding answers to all these questions is definitely NOT the purpose of one's Life.
Nobody will be able to find this Logically, Things just don't work at that animal level brain. Though You will feel good as if you are doing something. But this is a **rabbit-hole**. It's a circle you **must avoid. WHY? Because Time You have is limited.**
  
We also need to banish this thought so that it never disturbs us again and we are busy with the purpose we get.

## What is purpose of One's life?
>[!info] Making Living Better is the Purpose of One's Life. Achieve it With the three spheres of life

Survival of the Fittest. Nobody knows we might discover the key to live forever. But will everyone be able to access it. NO!! Resourceful People will get it first. *Again things are unpredictable but until then we may become resourceful and it's resourceful people who get it first..* Thus **become resourceful by earning money.** 
  
Just the way surpassing needs of **Survival and Procreation** opened gates to finding purpose in life. Similarly, breaking this glass wall of **Money-Making will open the gates** for other things so this is **the immediate purpose of one's life.** For anything to function we need best of the **System** which includes our health, mind and **Surroundings** which includes the wealth part. You need to be better in three fundamental spheres of your life in the following order for this:

- **Mind is what differentiates you from an animal**, It's what drove you here. If your mind controls you, You are fucked. Knowledge will help here. **"Mental Win"**
- **No Money No Honey**. Without money you will win the race you started alone. Finance will assist you. **"Social Win"**

Henceforth, Aim fixed: **To make living life better within the three principles by using correct means.** No Overthinking. Fix any one fantasy related to this as your motivation and get to work.
I want to achieve to an extent that even when I die I am proud of everything I did in my life and the way I did. I am not regretful of a single thing.


Life is a race but everybody does not have the same starting line. However the idea is to maintain the pace as it is a longer game.
Life is customizable. Create your own goals. Then try accomplishing them, but before that we need to, [Learn Time Management](02_It_All_Starts_Here.md), Use this resource Wisely and Watch what happens.....

Keep in mind, **Things should focus on general and not specific solutions**
Now Go, Attack those three spheres in order......
