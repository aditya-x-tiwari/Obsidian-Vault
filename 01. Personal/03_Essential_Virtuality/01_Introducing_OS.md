# 01_Introducing_OS
Operating System is what handles your interaction with the virtual world hence you need the following.
## Basic Functionalities Needed

### Compatibility
It should be able interact with you very nicely basically should be able to communicate to the system what exactly you need. It should also support software you need as per your desired task.
### Performance 
It should also be able to handle software without major performance issues. It should be able to perform things at good speeds and carry out basic tasks efficiently, customize itself as per needs and should have community support in case of failures.
### Absolute Control
Data is precious, we will spend the entire life building it we cannot afford to take any risks with this. Building Absolute control over something is difficult yet we can opt for systems that are at minimum risk and have many such systems to back up thus having a fail-safe mechanism. 
- **Free And Open Source(FOSS)** projects have no ownership and anyone can contribute to it. Popular ones are very less likely to crash and are limited by license. Hence this is a Gold Standard. 
### Remote Access
Data Access should not be limited to certain favorable conditions. It should be accessed from anywhere anytime it should also be Device independent.
Operating System is made for the user opting the best considering these factors is definitely good for our own local system but we also need to stick to what the general population uses as this does not create our own local machine as a dependency and we are compatible with the world.

You need two at maximum one which is the best and other which integrates with  everybody and is simple to use. 
Hence the one that is most optimal till time has its [Guide here](Linux_Guide), and the one used by others has its [Guide here](Windows_Guide).
Note that these are files containing details of how you are configuring them. It has got only those information which you will be needing.
