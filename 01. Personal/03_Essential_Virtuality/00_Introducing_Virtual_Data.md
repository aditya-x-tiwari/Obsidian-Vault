# 00_Introducing_Virtual_Data
Before, starting out anything understand that anything requires data from source and a medium i.e., language to communicate, to the Receiver, thus we got **Language as next big tool -** Middleman between Processing Data from Source. Data is duly present in English-language today, hence requires a global effort to learn and adopt to any new change. *Again things are unpredictable but until then we may become resourceful and it's resourceful people who get it first..*. **Hence, Data will be stored in English and You Should Learn it fluently**

It is very clear that data stored in the physical world is more likely to get destroyed. Hence we have a virtual world where things are stored on multiple machines so that we do not lose data. Let's know how to make use of this. So let's first dive into the memory management for this system [here](Memory_Management_Guide.md)

Virtual World is a system designed to generate, operate and store data. Hence we should cover these functionalities complying to the latest technology. Deviating from purpose is not welcomed.
First we need, Operating System simply because this is the base on which software runs.
Then we need the software to do our desired task and to work upon and,
Boom everything we need is done.
