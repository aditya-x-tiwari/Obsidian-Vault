# 02_Introducing_Software
Software is what meets the real world needs. It defines the way we work with data

## Basic Functionalities Needed
### Performance 
It should meet the desired function for which it is installed. It should be platform compatible
It should also be able to handle volumes of data without major performance issues. It should be able to perform things at good speeds and carry out basic tasks faster and efficiently, customize itself and should have community support in case of failures.
### Absolute Control
Data is precious, we will spend the entire life building it we cannot afford to take any risks with this. Building absolute control over something is difficult yet we can opt for systems that are at minimum risk and have many such systems to back up thus having a fail-safe mechanism. 
- **Free And Open Source(FOSS)** projects have no ownership and anyone can contribute to it. Popular ones are very less likely to crash. Hence this is a Gold Standard. In addition to that it's free.
### Remote Access
Data Access should not be limited to certain favorable conditions. Software should be able to work with data from anywhere
- **Local storage** ensures data access anytime we have our own device even without the internet.
- **Cloud-Based Storage** ensures remote access through any device around the world with just a internet connection.

## Common_Softwares_Discussed

On top of  the Operating System we get certain software which performs desired tasks. Computer perceives things differently hence dedicated software exists even under non-differentiable human subcategories. Covering all subcategories is not desirable but all that is discussed is what is enough to serve general purposes and not specific ones. Two Options for each category is given the first, **bold option** is generally the best while second  *italic option* is better for the mass use. 
Note that each links to file which gives detailed guide to it.
Hence till time classifying them we have,

#### Generation Systems:
Generations are based on data someone is trained on with. It can be from your mind, machine or even surrounding's creation. All that is available on the internet. Internet can be used through Firefox(Websites) or Specific Apps(Software). It's difficult to rank creations as they are new and we have no data other than previous creations to rank them but still classifying based on creativeness we have,

- **Text**: Trained LLMs (Prefer Local ones over new major advancements)

And more coming up this is very unstable and new field which keeps on changing
