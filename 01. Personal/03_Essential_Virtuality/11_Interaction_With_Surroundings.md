# 11_Interaction_With_Surroundings
We have discussed System as a whole earlier. Indulging with surroundings is though small but an integral part of your identity. Rules do change here. You need to adopt what the masses find easier to work with. Freedom of Choice can be exercised for software that we use alone. 

Understanding things as System and Surroundings. We have discussed the system in lot detail. Let's focus on surroundings because it is from where we get our resources from. Humans are social animals we survive in groups it is embedded inside of us hence your **interference with society should be constructive and not destructive.** 
First understand that the interferences with **people are conditional** because **Self-Preservation is the strongest extinct** and the **unconditionality only arises during the blind perception of anything** say mother loving children she is guided by evolution here as she thinks it's her creation, soldiers love for motherland is also a thought driven blind perception put into them. 
Remember that **when it comes to kill or be killed everyone is bound to save themselves,**  People with unconditional relationship for something may defy this because they think dying with a hollow soul is worse than dying with a purpose. While this is an extreme but this is the base of human interaction.

>[!tip] Blind Perception develops over time while any sort of short interaction is mutually conditional

From the above abstract it seems due to mutual interaction there is only room for need based interactions. This is the core, but this all of it just becomes mundane and very objective-based society. In reality this is very complicated, you may need to some degree show that you genuinely care for someone, you are unconditional. Why?
You need to adopt what the masses work with.. Some are not aware of the reality, people do expect the world to be helpful, they escape the core to believe this and for you to win this battle you too need to show that you genuinely care. Similar to this, there are many markers that you need to stand by to make the interference constructive while obeying rules of the society.
Now we are in a dilemma what to do should we fake?
World would have been a better place if people actually cared, though everybody tries to a certain degree, Humans have advanced to a point that this would actually be possible but the survival extinct is the strongest. Hence we should reflect in the same way and never trust anyone otherwise we will fail completely. In short we should be like a mirror, reflecting people's behavior. Note that nor the person or the people like the person who is related to everybody. **Have necessary relations, time and energy is limited.**

Start by showing to some possible degree of care to everybody. If the other person gives it back then continue else not, else if person only does the necessary talking, never try to overindulge reflect the same thing back else if the person always talks rudely, try avoiding the person never ever flinch to show 0.01% of human empathy to this person You should not take in his behavior.

The whole thing can be summarized in the following lines,



**Core subjects** you should understand at a basic level to interact smoothly, confidently, and meaningfully with others are
- **Psychology**: Understand human behavior, emotions, and motivations.  
- **Communication**:  Express yourself clearly and understand others.  
- **Civics / Basic Law / Ethics**: Know your rights and responsibilities in society.  
- **Cultural Literacy / Worldview**: Interact respectfully and intelligently with people from different backgrounds.  Depends on Location.


To be a part of society you need to function sometimes according to it. . Avoid the **trap of indulging too much as it's not much helpful. Stay Diplomatic**

Just **define values for parameters defined by society** like your Identity(Nationality, Religion, Caste, Passport),Laws, Status etc., Choose more ethnic or universal ones so that you are identifiable to more part of the  population.
Nothing to question here as change happens when masses are involved instead, change yourself and the society follows. How you interact physically is somewhat constant while Virtuality is what evolves rapidly. [Link here](11_Interaction_With_Surroundings)
Humans are social beings. **Never Be Bad to people for Your Own Self-Benefit**
Once you have the right set of data, the **next big thing is Execution** execute greater things in life with consistency and watch yourself progress. Goodbye!! 
### Identification
You will die one day. Nobody cares but you should be identified in the world for what you actually are. No effort needs to be projected, rather hide unnecessary details.

### Personal Communication 
This is important as things are achieved at a faster pace with faster communication. 
Popular Software include :
- WhatsApp - Universal standard for communication among known people.
- Telegram - More Privacy and larger file support but less common 
### Mass Communication 
Standing by the quote below it completely makes sense why we need it. 

>[!tip] Your Network = Your Networth.

Hence, Popular Software which are System Dominant include :
- Youtube - Pays for attention seeking communication with the masses.
- Instagram - Does not pay for Mass Communication but very popular due to its features.

Hence, Popular Software which are Surroundings Dominant include : 
- Twitter - Trending News and getting People's opinions
- Inshorts - Relevant news within 60 words for the day

Real-Time Ones are also used sometimes :
- Virtual One-One Meetings: Zoom/Meet
- Gmail: Thunderbird
