## AI 
Artificial intelligence today has surpassed human limits, it has all of the worlds data compressed into its form at the fingertips. It is a information source foe just anything.  It is the best source of information but often lacks depth and needs a lot improvement. It will certainly happen in future but note that it will always be a average information of what's available. It will not be **fixed reference** as Ai can make things up. It will not be reviewed and revised. **Books are mathematics or weight lifting while Ai is calculators or machines which make human work easier** dependencies on AI can lead to **loss of the skill for thinking itself.** Hence let's discuss best books for each subject one by one 
## Subjects
There are thousands of subjects in the world but the question is are they made for a single person. Answer is no. This is just not possible. Human work in their specific niches. But do they not need other subjects in life? No, we need it, but not at such details. Thus, here I list subjects and the consecutive books under it that every man should read. Read them maintain short notes on folders here and most importantly implement them in our lives.
