Learning on given data is the immediate first purpose for working of a system. We humans have been learning things from the beginning here I will discuss how to learn things the best way. We learn least through passive learning from books, audio visuals and best through hands on learning like discussion, teaching others etc.

## Method
 See, nothing beats **Hands on learning it is no doubt the best way of learning.** 
 The number of motor unit recruitment in learning things by hand is by far huge than what you can learn from watching and hearing, its solving sums for mathematics, real world learning or animations for science etc., like doing exactly what is needed. 
 Note that **You are not a storage system.**

 >[!warning] I saw great things a few months ago like how to build this and that, I executed none of them. Today I saw those thumbnails again, I remember I saw that video but cannot remember the content. Maybe I could, if I see that in 2.5x but what was the output from it. nothing. What matters is what you actually do and nothing else. 

More Time spent on learning is inversely proportional to learning.
Studying should start with minimal concise knowledge and understood deeply through hands on learning. The same standard and concise knowledge should be present for future reference when needed. In case you forget everything or have gaps in learning, **testing is the best way to recall** even if you get least marks in that test but you will learn maximum from it as that is the way our brains are built for not ideally consuming material by re and rereading them. **Ideally this should not happen since you forgot things as you didn't need them.** Consume what is actually needed for you rather than useless information which you learn once and have no application in the future.
Know your purpose behind learning that thing.

Incorporate other active learning methods to further enhance learning, as discussed here [Active Learning Methods](D_Cognition) like pausing some time while learning as it creates more repetitions of the skill in the hippocampus part of the brain during REM sleep. 


## Material
What you need is a minimal and concise knowledge at first followed by hands on learning.
But for most of the things you do not have the access to hands on learning part easily. So what's the next best source for learning. Active Learning methods like teaching and demonstration are done after learning but what about without having prior knowledge.

>[!tip]  Concise books are definitely preferred over over-explained ones as they give less load on cognition

Answer is simple books. Books are the most trusted source of information as things are reviewed revised in case of lectures words once spelled can't be taken back they can be misleading, also these will not cover recent research for that we got online platforms where information is available most readily from experts.
 Only problem is they are time taking but there's a solution. The ideal way is to skim the books like learn how to read them in different scenarios (you do not need to read it word by word each time). 
Next with minimal theory apply the knowledge to scenarios and done you know it now.

Another thing we can do is question. Questioning is a great way you can do this. Actually the best way because things are asked by us only. The point is truly understanding the thing. AI can help us here.

>[!tip] Now books do need to be updated so it's very important to have the right concept.

Coming to Notes....... 
They are important only for cases where hands on learning is writing answers on a paper. Otherwise maybe for organizing information in a single place when proper books are not available.  Notes can be a great way to arrange information in brief. It reduces cognitive loads in a 
better way.
Anyways Linear Note taking has to be the best as it is the only format acceptable to most of the world. Mind maps should be a derivative of it but base should always be Linear, as you need to keep at par with millions of brains working since centuries to develop something.

>[!tip] Handbooks are nothing but a way to skim actual books, it is a form of reading them.


Hence just one book serves as the most detailed as well as the most brief source of information when read correctly
Again repeating reading material is not enough it is just a way to get knowledge into the system real learning is hands-on learning. No notes nothing.



Let's criticize the method of watching lectures from YouTube or maybe the professor you're  learning from in that way the teacher does not address the student's specific problems but focuses on the general problems that a lot of time is wasted while talking writing the things and explaining the things that are easily understandable. It's a passive form of learning. Switch to active methods listed earlier. 
Reading a over explained book is also not a good. First because publishers prefer thick books but brain is very good to concise information not over explained things 
Reading Concise material while understanding them is the most time saving and effective learning other than practical learning methods.


So do you need to maintain the handbooks or resources to learn. Actually no most of the times, this is done by a community, if a person tries to do it it is definitely a wastage of time.
A person should focus on learning more. Maintaining resources is undesirable except when things are pertaining to understanding one's self where it becomes absolutely necessary to do this and in places where community isn't present and the person needs to do things all on his own and resources aren't adequate. 

Community driven resources should be editable and keep up with the stable change. This is executed by reprinting book editions, latest videos available on online platforms etc.
Lets make a list of the books and information sources we need for learning different subjects in life 
Let's make use of all these and learn!!
