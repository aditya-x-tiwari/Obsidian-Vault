## **3. How to Differentiate Between Good and Bad Assets/Liabilities?**

  - Example: Luxury cars, expensive gadgets  

### **Good Liabilities vs Bad Liabilities**

  - Help you acquire valuable assets (e.g., education loans for higher studies)  
  - Low-interest loans for investments in real estate or business expansion

## **4. The Balance Sheet Approach: Net Worth Calculation**
Your **net worth** is the difference between your total assets and total liabilities. 

### **Formula:**  
```
Net Worth = Total Assets – Total Liabilities
```

### **Example of a Simple Balance Sheet:**
| **Category**    | **Value (₹)** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Cash Savings    | 2,00,000      |
| Stocks & ETFs   | 5,00,000      |
| Real Estate     | 25,00,000     |
| **Total Assets**| 32,00,000     |
| Credit Card Debt| 50,000        |
| Car Loan        | 3,00,000      |
| **Total Liabilities**| 3,50,000 |
| **Net Worth**   | 28,50,000     |

This calculation gives a clear picture of your financial health. If your **liabilities are too high compared to your assets**, it indicates financial risk.
