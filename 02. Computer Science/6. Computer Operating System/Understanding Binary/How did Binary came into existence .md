### Why Binary in Computers ?

Computers work with electrical circuits, which can be either **on** or **off**. So, Using binary digits becomes a necessity:

- **0** = off (low voltage)
- **1** = on (high voltage)

Real World Information is not binary. Hence it needs to be interconvertible to represent all kinds of information, from numbers to text, images, and even videos. 

### How is data stored in Binary ? 

- Decimal Numbers: Numbers are infinite, we cannot have a unique binary number for each. Using logic is the only solution. Conversion from higher base systems like decimals to lower base systems like binary will involve breaking data into huge binary numbers.
