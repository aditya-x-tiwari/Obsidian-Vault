 [Perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception)  involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and  [proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) ) as well as the  [cognitive processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition)  involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through the interpretation of stimuli.[18] Early psychologists like  [Edward B. Titchener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Titchener)  began to work with perception in their structuralist approach to psychology.  [Structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology))  dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or "consciousness", as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining an understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.[19]
Current perspectives on perception within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of perception is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment.[20]
